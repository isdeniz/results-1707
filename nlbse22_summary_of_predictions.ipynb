Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.--&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `&lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt;` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `&lt;kirby-page&gt;`, and it would render its contents within the `&lt;ion-content&gt;` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `<kirby-page-top-content>` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `<kirby-page>`, and it would render its contents within the `<ion-content>` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- <kirby-page-top-content> not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple <kirby-page-top-content> tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n   \n",

Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.--&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `&lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt;` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `&lt;kirby-page&gt;`, and it would render its contents within the `&lt;ion-content&gt;` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `<kirby-page-top-content>` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `<kirby-page>`, and it would render its contents within the `<ion-content>` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- <kirby-page-top-content> not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple <kirby-page-top-content> tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n   \n",

Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.--&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `&lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt;` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `&lt;kirby-page&gt;`, and it would render its contents within the `&lt;ion-content&gt;` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky.

Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `<kirby-page-top-content>` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `<kirby-page>`, and it would render its contents within the `<ion-content>` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- <kirby-page-top-content> not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple <kirby-page-top-content> tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n   \n",
